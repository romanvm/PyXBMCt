PyXBMCt
=======

PyXBMCt is a mini-framework which simplifies UI creation for XBMC addons. It was inspired by PyQt GUI framework (hence the name) and provides a main window and a number of controls (widgets). The main windows serves as a parent widget for the controls much like QtGui.QWidget class and provides a grid layout manager to place the controls.

The docunentation for the framework classes can be found here: http://romanvm.github.io/PyXBMCt/docs

The framework uses image textures from XBMC Confluence skin.
