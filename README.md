PyXBMCt
=======

PyXBMCt is a mini-framework which simplifies UI creation for Kodi (XBMC) addons. It was inspired by PyQt GUI framework
(hence the name) and provides a main window and a number of controls (widgets).
The main windows serves as a parent widget for the controls much like QtGui.QWidget class and provides a grid layout
manager to place the controls.
